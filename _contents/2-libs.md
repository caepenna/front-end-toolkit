## JQuery

Is an open source JavaScript librabry designed to simplify HTML document traversing,
event handling, animating, and Ajax interactions. Its slogan is **"Write less, do more"**.

Here some other features that made us choose to use JQuery:

- Is lightweight and easy to use;
- Handles cross-browser issues;
- Boosts page load time;
- Is extensible and has a wide range of official and third-party plug-ins;
- Is constantly evolved and has an active community.
