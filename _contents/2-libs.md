## JQuery

## Select2
Select2 gives you a customizable select box with support for searching, tagging, remote data sets, infinite scrolling, and many other highly used options.

Is easy to install and use, don't need knowledge in Javascript.

```javascript
  $('.my-select').select2();
```

The reason why we use Select2 is because is preaty hard to stylize select tags.
