## JQuery

## Select2

[Select2](https://select2.github.io/) gives you a customizable select box with support for searching, tagging, remote data sets, infinite scrolling, and many other highly used options.

**We choose to use when:**

Almost everytime that we want to use a `<select>` HTML element. Mostly because browser default lacks of a good visual design and has a poor user experience.

Usage is simple. Like many other JS libs just require the lib file, query the element and initialize as a Select2 instance.

```javascript
  $('.my-select').select2();
```
