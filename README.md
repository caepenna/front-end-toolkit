[Our front end toolkit page](https://flama.github.io/front-end-toolkit/)

## How to contribute

You should feel free to contribute with Pull Requests.

This project was created using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). It would be nice to install Jekyll if you'd like to contribute with new content. If you contribution is only with minor changes, you can do it without installing Jekyll.

To help you with your contributions, it is nice to follow this structure when possible:
- When should you use the documented practice?
- What is this practice?
- What are some applied examples? (both right and wrong)
- Why is this the best solution? It's nice to have references here.
- What are other diverging approaches, and why not use them?
